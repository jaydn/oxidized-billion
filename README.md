# Oxidized Billion router model
Goes in your Oxidized config folder under `model/`
Default `/root/.config/oxidized/model`

Tested only on latest firmware on:
- 7800NXL
- 8700AXL
- 8900X R3

You will get periodic updates for state that probably shouldn't be stored in the config like next DHCP address - either ignore it or gsub it out in the module like a number of them have been already
